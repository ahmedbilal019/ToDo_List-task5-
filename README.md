# ToDo_List-task5-
This ToDo list is created using React where user can add, update, marked/unmark and delete tasks.
I use CSS Library "Bootstrap" for styling and "Context APi" for passing props to the componenets. 
This app is responsive for different screen widths such as for laptops,mobile and tablets.
